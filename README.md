# A03-project-BattleShip
BattleShip team's proposal

These are the requirements for Assignment 3

For each of the two project proposals you need to do the following:
1. Describe the project in one or two paragraphs
If possible include a drawing or diagram
2. Include a UML use case diagram that describes all actors and all major interactions.
The use case diagram should list at least 3 interactions
3. Divide up the implementation work (4 weeks) into tasks.
If a task takes longer than a week, divide it up into smaller tasks.
Create a table of all the tasks T1, T2, T3, â€¦ .
Each task should have a clear description that is verifiable
Each task should including any dependencies, and each task should be verifiable
4. Create a preliminary 4 week schedule
Find a software tool to create a Gantt chart (similar to Figure 23.6 in the book)
There are a number of free project management tools (more toole) available online. However, for our
purpose a diagramming program like for example Visio works just fine.
Keep in mind that a schedule only has value if it is used on a regular basis. Prefer clarity over excessive
detail
5. Create a staff allocation chart similar to Figure 23.7 in the book
